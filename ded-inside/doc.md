Main mechanics:

- dead cells like slasher fighting,
- labyrinth-like location (NOT random), one spawn point, 
- player loses all items on death,
- focus on speedrunning and player skill/knowledge growth,
- lots of secrets & shortcuts,
- in the end, each player build would look like a path in the labyrinth,


Stretch goals:
- world tencency (kinda like demon's souls)
- resident evil like puzzles


Idea source:

- mental illnesses as bosses/locations to pass,
